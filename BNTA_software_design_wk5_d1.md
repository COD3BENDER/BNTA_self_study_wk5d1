# Software Design Methodologies

1. What do we mean by **coupling** and **cohesion** when discussing structured design?
    1. Coupling indicates the level of dependence between classes or packages, meaning that if one thing is changed in a class, this would also need to be adjusted on other classes that depends on it otherwise it could cause errors in the software. Cohesion indicates the level of which classes relate to one another. When discussing structured design, a module with Low Coupling and High Cohesion allows the code to be easier to change, read and easier to test.
2. What is the difference between **top-down** and **bottom-up** design? Which best describes a function oriented design?
    1. The top down approach uses modularisation by trying to solve the whole system, by breaking it down into smaller modules, where each module undergoes the same breakdown and solved manually until the system is completed. This best describes the function oriented design as it aims to solve the function of the software using stepwise refinement. 
    2. The bottom down approach works on developing individual parts of the the system, solving the smaller problems first and then linking them together to solve the whole system, this allows for component reusability. This best describes Object oriented programming.
3. In which design methodology would a **class diagram** be most useful?
    1. Class diagrams would be most useful for Object Oriented Design as it can visually display relationships between classes or objects. It also provides an overview of the application which is a benefit as it can be hard to understand the main objective of the project when using OOP/bottom down approach.
4. What are the **four pillars of object oriented programming**? Give a single-sentence description of each. 
    1. Encapsulation - Is where data is hidden and only accessed through methods when needed using the private keyword, this increases the security and integrity of a program as the data is only accessible where needed.
    2. Inheritance -  Allows a class (child) to inherit all attributes and methods from another class (parent) using the extends keyword and super() in the constructor of the child class, though super() is implicitly called if the parent class has a default constructor.
    3. Abstraction - declares methods and variables without instantiating or implementing them. interfaces uses abstraction to a blueprint for classes that implements them, overcoming the limitation Java has with single inheritance since, classes can implement multiple interfaces.
    4. Polymorphism - This is were methods in the child class can have the same name as the parent class, but carry out different functions. often denoted with @override annotation or where different objects can be accessed using the parent interface. In the case of static polymorphism methods can have a different function using overloading and is often denoted using the @overload annotation. 
5. What is the **strategy pattern**? How would its implementation differ between a functional and object oriented system?
    1. This is where multiple algorithms are implemented and then chosen interchangeably at runtime. 
        1. In OOP - An interface is used to create multiple concrete implementations of strategies and the algorithm is chosen at runtime using objects.
        2. In FP - no interface is needed, only functions are created to implement different algorithms, where they can also be used as arguments to other functions and also return functions. 
6. Imagine you are creating a new online payment system. In order to gain maximum market share it can't be tied to a particular sector - it needs to work just as well when ordering a takeaway as when buying a new coat. Which design methodology would you suggest following? Give some justification for your decision.
    1. I would choose the Object Oriented Design approach, since it cant be tied to any particular sector, interfaces can be used to give a template of what classes should look like, allowing for easy modification due to low coupling, where classes/methods can be added/removed depending on the use case while maintaining core functionality. OOP is based on the bottom up approach which is more scalable for complex systems as it allows for code reuse making data redundancy lower and also allows for flexibility, allowing developers to adapt the program to suit any needs. By also using interfaces, polymorphism will allow the system to work the same when buying a coat or ordering food from a takeaway.
